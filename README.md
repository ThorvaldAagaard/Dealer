Dealer by Hans van Staveren

Install Flex and Bison from https://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/files/win_flex_bison3-latest.zip/download

The simplest is to download the above zip-file and extract the 2 executables
win_flex.exe and win_bison.exe

Then run

make.bat

If all is OK, you can type

dealer

in the command prompt

Then type: produce 10

And press Ctrl-z

You should now see output from dealer
